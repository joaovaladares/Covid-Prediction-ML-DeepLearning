# Covid-Prediction-ML-DeepLearning

In this project we made several models to predict wheter a patient had COVID or not given his/her chest x-ray image. And to do that were applied some techniques such as image augmentation and known data preprocessing/visualizing techniques.

For this project we used the following models: 
- VGG16
- Two different ResNet 50 v2
- DenseNet
- GoogLeNet

Text is in PT-BR since it's the final project for CS UFPE Machine Learning course
